# Chromatin Bound Protein Model

RStan model to determine if a protein has a preference for binding chromatin. Mass spec intensities for samples from chromatin enriched and chromatin depleted (i.e. cytoplasmic) samples across different cell lines are used to determine the fraction of total protein abundance bound to chromatin.
